The wolf and the fox want to eat the rabbit, but it wasn't easy to catch him.
 
One day the wolf says to the fox, "You go home and lie in bed. I'll tell the rabbit that you are dead. When he comes to look at you, you can jump up and catch him." That's a good idea," says the fox.
 
The fox goes home at once. The wolf goes  to the rabbit's house and knocked at the door. "Who is it?" asks the rabbit. "It's the wolf. I come to tell you that the fox is dead." Then the wolf goes away.

The rabbit goes to the fox's house. He looked in through the window and sees the fox lying in bed with his eyes closed. He thinks, "Is the fox really dead or is he pretending to be dead? If he's not dead, he'll catch me when I go near him." so he said, "The wolf says that the fox is dead. But he doesn't look like a dead fox. The mouth of a dead fox is always open." When the fox hears this, he thinks, "I'll show him that I'm dead." So he opened his mouth.
 
The rabbit knows that the fox isn't dead, and he rans away quickly.
